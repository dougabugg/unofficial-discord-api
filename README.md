# unofficial-discord-api
The Discord app can be launched in a web browser; therefore, it should be possible to inject custom javascript into the page to automate things like reading messsages and sending new messages. That is the goal of this project. I would ask that if you're using this project, please don't do anything that violates Discord's Terms of Service, is malicious in nature, or anything in general that might get the attention of Discord. Anytime the official Discord web app client is updated, this library is likely to break, and it wouldn't be that hard for Discord to add code to detect and break this library, making development harder. If you want to make a "true discord bot", see the [Official Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). The primary goal of this project is to provide a library for augmenting the official Discord application to provide features like accesibility and automation, not to circumvent Discord's policy on bots and apps (just use the official API!)
